My personal "webpage"

## What is this repo used for?

This repo is primarily for my semi-automated plaintext file hosting solution!

Scrumbin, my plaintext file hosting utility, has automation built into it to save my files to this relatively free webserver through one of my tokens!

## Where can I set up my own instance of Scrumbin?

I'm currently working on a deployable version of Scrumbin. Once that's up and running, I'll share a link to it here, but it'll also be accessible on my profile!

## Where can I find all of the various plaintext files that you like sharing?

The code folder contains every file that hasn't been archived and a log that shows all of the files from from oldest to newest. Feel free to look through any of them; if they are here then I have no issues sharing any of their contents!

## Why do you have so many semi-validated commits to this repo?

Scrumbin automation makes a commit on my behalf every time I upload a text file. Just in testing, this has created a LOT of commits. In the future, I am sure it will have some obscene number.
